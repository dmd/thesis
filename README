This repository contains all the code I wrote in the service of my thesis.

Most of the more useful and general-purpose bits are available, and explained via the <a href="http://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/public:matlab_tools">lab wiki</a>.

The rest is rather idiosyncratic and single-purpose, and is highly unlikely to be of use to you.

The <a href="http://3e.org/dmd/scents/archives/373">subversion history</a> was lost in a tragic accident involving a corn muffin, but there's not much of interest there to anyone but me.
