This repository contains all the code I wrote in the service of my thesis:

 * [Distinguishing Conjoint and Independent Neural Tuning for Stimulus Features With fMRI Adaptation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2694123/?tool=pmcentrez)
 * [Different Spatial Scales of Shape Similarity Representation in Lateral and Ventral LOC
](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2742590/?tool=pmcentrez)

All of this is licensed under the latest version of the MIT License.

Most of the more useful and general-purpose bits are available, and explained via the [lab wiki](http://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/public:matlab_tools).

Much of the rest is rather idiosyncratic and single-purpose, and is highly unlikely to be of use to you unless you're doing very, very similar work to my own.
