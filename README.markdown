This repository contains all the code I wrote in the service of my thesis.

All of this is licensed under the [Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/).

Most of the more useful and general-purpose bits are available, and explained via the [lab wiki](http://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/public:matlab_tools).

Much of the rest is rather idiosyncratic and single-purpose, and is highly unlikely to be of use to you unless you're doing very, very similar work to my own.

The [revision history](http://3e.org/dmd/scents/archives/373) was lost in a tragic accident involving a corn muffin, but there's not much of interest there to anyone but me.
